Patient’s smile is the biggest assets that you earn in this profession. Furthermore, you will get an opportunity to work in the remote which provides you with challenge and responsibilities with limited resources.</p>
                            <p>All you need is five and half year’s hard study following the higher secondary. Furthermore you need three more years for specialization and additional years for super specialization if you want to. If you really want to move in this path, there are many medical colleges in the country. Tribhuvan University and Kathmandu University have its own campus and few more affiliated colleges and does the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences at Dharan and Patan Academy of Medical Sciences at Patan. You need to seat in the entrance of the respective universities to become eligible for study.</p>
                            <p>There are many scholarship opportunities also. IOM and BPKIHS have heavily subsidized quotas where you can study at cheaper rate. Similarly, Ministry of Education has few scholarship seats in every private medical college. To eligible for these quotas, one needs to seat in the entrance examination taken by the ministry itself. Similarly, PAHS has few seats in heavily subsidized quotas and few in partially subsidized quotas. PAHS also take examination by itself. Besides these, there are few scholarship quotas in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and China. Indian and Pakistan Embassies take examination for their scholarship seats where as for Bangladesh and China, selection is done by the MOE.</p>

                            <h2>A-LEVEL</h2>
                            <p>A-levels course is affiliated to Cambridge University, UK. It has gained popularity amongst Nepali students because in A-levels, the student does not really have to go through courses that they do not feel like studying. Even though the courses 
                            available in the UK have much more variety, quite a selection is on offer from the British Council and numerous colleges here. 
                            A-level students have the opportunity to choose subjects even though the fields might clash. They are able to take Economics, 
                            Biology and Chemistry at the same time or take one subject from each field like Chemistry, Sociology and Business Studies. New 
                            subjects such as Environmental Management, Psychology, Geography and Tourism have recently been introduced.</p>

                            <p>Fine Art has a long history in Nepal. The first school established was ‘Art School’ in 1903. The subject is the best for the creative students. There are various Fine Arts colleges in and outside the valley that provide intermediate courses in Fine Arts. The Intermediate has classes on the basics of drawing and painting, and sculpture. English and Nepali are the compulsory subjects. 
                            While some colleges don’t offer the graphic part of the designing, some like Institute of Fine Arts, at Ganabahal, a newly opened Fine Arts institution, has such offering. Further into the course, classes on classical instruments, classical dances, textile designing and so forth are available</p>
